    description: |
      Now you can start translating strings, a few notes before you start:
        - Translation strings start after an equals sign and are enclosed in quotation marks
        - There are variables before the equal sign, they do not need to be translated.
        - Also, if you come across characters <kbd>{0}</kbd>, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, <kbd>[Y/N]</kbd> or file names, then just skip them.
        
      Good luck to you.
